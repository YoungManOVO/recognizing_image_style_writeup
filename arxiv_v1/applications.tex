\subsection{Applications of style classifiers}

Style classifiers learned on our datasets can be used toward novel goals.
For example, sources of stock photography or design inspiration may be better navigated with a vocabulary of style.
Currently, companies expend labor to manually annotate stock photography with such labels.
With our approach, any image collection can be searchable and rankable by style.
We apply style classifiers to the PASCAL visual object class dataset, and show top hits for different styles for the ``bird'' and ``train'' categories in~\autoref{fig:search_demo}.

Additionally, styles learned from photographs can be used to order paintings, and styles learned from paintings can be used to order photographs, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:photo_painting}.
