\subsection{Application: Style-Based Image Search}

\input{../flickr_on_flickr_mini}

Style classifiers learned on our datasets can be used toward novel goals.
For example, sources of stock photography or design inspiration may be better navigated with a vocabulary of style.
Currently, companies expend labor to manually annotate stock photography with such labels.
With our approach, any image collection can be searchable and rankable by style.

To demonstrate, we apply our Flickr-learned style classifiers to a new dataset of 80K images gathered on Pinterest (also available with our code release); some results are shown in \autoref{fig:flickr_on_pinterest}.
Interestingly, styles learned from photographs can be used to order paintings, and styles learned from paintings can be used to order photographs, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:photo_painting}.
