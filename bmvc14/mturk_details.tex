Test images were grouped into 10 images per Human Interface Task (HIT). Each task asks the Turker to evaluate the style (e.g., ``Is this image VINTAGE?'') for each image.  For each style, we provided a short blurb describing the style in words, and provided 12-15 hand-chosen positive and negative examples for each Flickr Group.
Each HIT included 2 sentinels: images which were very clearly positives and similar to the examples.  HITs were rejected when Turkers got both sentinels wrong.
Turkers were paid $0.10$ per HIT, and were allowed to perform multiple hits.  Manual inspection of the results indicate that the Turkers understood the task and were performing effectively.  A few Turkers sent unsolicited feedback indicating that they were really enjoying the HITs (``some of the photos are beautiful'') and wanted to perform them as effectively as possible.
