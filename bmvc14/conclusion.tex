\subsection{Discussion}

We have made significant progress in defining the problem of understanding photographic style.
We provide a novel dataset that exhibits several types of styles not previously considered in the literature, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in prediction of both style and aesthetic quality.
These results are comparable to human performance.
We also show that style is highly content-dependent.

Style plays a significant role in much of the manmade imagery we experience daily, and there is considering need for future work to further answer the question ``What is style?''

One of the most interesting outcomes of this work is the success of features trained for object detection for both aesthetic and style classification.
We propose several possible hypotheses to explain these results.
Perhaps the network layers that we use as features are extremely good as general visual features for image representation in general.
Another explanation is that object recognition depends on object appearance, e.g., distinguishing red from white wine, or different kinds of terriers, and that the model learns to repurpose these features for image style.
Understanding and improving on these results is fertile ground for future work.
